    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Lokesh — a results-driven Microsoft 365 Engineer with extensive experience in Exchange Online, Defender and Purview products. 
      Proven expertise in deploying, managing, and troubleshooting complex Exchange Online environments while implementing robust security measures 
      to safeguard organizational data. Strong problem-solving abilities and excellent communication skills, dedicated to providing exceptional support 
      and driving continuous improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a Messaging Specialist at CIBC, I play a central role in maintaining a highly available and stable Microsoft 365 messaging environment, 
      with a strong focus on email security, hygiene, and archiving across both cloud and on‑premises systems. My day‑to‑day responsibilities include 
      proactive monitoring, incident response, and participation in disaster recovery drills, where I help incorporate lessons learned into future strategies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve successfully led several large‑scale initiatives, including designing and implementing mail‑flow rerouting for over 70,000 users, 
      automating the purge of sensitive emails for more than 14,000 accounts, and migrating 4,000+ mailboxes to meet strict data residency regulations. 
      To further strengthen resiliency, I deployed air‑gapped, immutable backups and introduced ProofPoint Continuity to ensure uninterrupted email 
      communications during outages. I’ve also integrated multiple applications with secure Graph APIs, enhancing both reliability and security across the environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through these projects, I’ve helped CIBC reduce operational risk, improve compliance, and ensure that critical communication systems remain secure, 
      resilient, and efficient at enterprise scale.
